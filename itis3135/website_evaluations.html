		<h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
		<h3>Jacob's Wonderful Web Development Work</h3>
		<!-- For each site, a section element, and within it the name 
		(as a clickable link, as an h3) - if you haven't already adjust 
		your default.css so you your links are not blue/purple/red... 
		use pseudo classes to adjust things. -->
		
		<!-- Within that section put a paragraph with a simple description 
		of the site, followed by an unordered list with each of the CRAP principles, 
		followed by your assessment of the site's following/not following of those 
		principles in the form of a sentence or two.  -->
		
		<!--Submit the URL to your course index page, 
		which should in turn include a menu with a link to this page. -->
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/home.html">HP.com</a></h3>
		<!-- Paragraph with simple description of site + unordered list -->
			<p>HP’s website offers a wide variety of computing and printing-related solutions. Customers can 
		   efficiently order laptops, desktops, printers, or even support-related services from this website. 
		   HP also offers its products at various retail stores. HP is known worldwide for its wide range of 
		   products initially stated above.
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Contrast: The readability of HP’s website is very easy. Elements do appear to be similar which helps 
					me read the contents of the webpage to find the specific product I want quickly and easily. The elements 
					do seem to follow the principles really well! Images are less bright with darker text to improve readability.</li>
					
					<li>Repetition: The font and visual elements, in general, appear to follow this principle extremely well. The 
					website is easy to navigate, and clicking the shop button creates a red banner at the top of the screen to 
					increase the chances of the users clicking on the “SHOP” button which includes text referring to a sale and free 
					shipping.</li>
					
					<li>Alignment: The alignment of HP’s website is very easy for users to navigate. Everything appears to be grouped by 
					columns. This helps users find exactly what they want without scanning the page needlessly for the information they are 
					looking for.</li>
					
					<li>Proximity: The proximity of elements on HP’s website appears to be well-spaced but also fits in a professional manner. 
					Everything is easy for a user to navigate, and the alignment of the elements is equal.</li>
				</ul>
		
		<h3><a href="http://thebiguglywebsite.com/">TheBigUglyWebsite.com</a></h3>
			<p>TheBigUglyWebsite was created as an example to showcase the horrors of not following C.R.A.P. principles. 
			This website appears to do its job pretty well, and clicking the hyperlinks in the website brings the user 
			other webpages to showcase how UGLY they are!
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Contrast: The contrast of this website isn’t that great. The color of the background and text on the website startup appear 
					normal, but taking a look at the images can completely throw users off.</li>
					
					<li>Repetition: Images do appear to be repeated, but they aren’t following CRAPS principles. The colors of the images and text vary, 
					similarly, the size of the images appear to be all over the place.</li>
					
					<li>Alignment: The alignment of the images and text on this webpage appears to be everywhere. Images overlap other images. The alignment 
					of everything on the webpage appears to be towards the left of the webpage. This means the whole right side of this webpage appears to be blank.</li>
					
					<li>Proximity: The proximity of the elements on this webpage appears to be pretty close together. The elements feel pretty unprofessional since images 
					are thrown in between random subject headings, and some images even overlap with mismatching colors. Some of the subject headings appear to also have 
					mismatching colors and animations (increased / decreased size, etc.).</li>
				</ul>
		<h3>C.R.A.P. Principles - Notes</h3>
			<p>Contrast:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Elements that aren’t the same should be very different so they stand out and are easy to read.</li>
					<li>Contrast helps visibility. Making them only slightly different can make your work hard to read.</li>
					<li>Contrast draws attention and improves readability.</li>
				</ol>
			<p>Repetition:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Repeating visual elements of design throughout the piece.</li>
					<li>This brings a sense of uniformity and professionalism to the work.</li>
					<li>This includes: colors, fonts, font size, shapes, and line thickness.</li>
				</ol>
			<p>Alignment:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>All elements should line up and be organized.</li>
					<li>Every element should have some visual connection with another element on the page.</li>
					<li>Straight alignment or tilt alignment.</li>
					<li>Alignment <em>ORGANIZES</em> your work</li>
				</ol>
			<p>Proximity:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Elements that are related should be grouped together.</li>
					<li>Separate design elements should have enough space in between to communicate they are different.</li>
					<li>Grouping elements together helps your reader know where to look.</li>
				</ol>
